# Quick Sort in Java

This is a basic implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm in Java. Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

## Usage

1. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.

2. Modify the main method in the QuickSort class to use your own array of numbers.

3. Run the program.
